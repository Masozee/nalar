# Next.js Development Performance Optimizations

## üöÄ Quick Start

Use these optimized commands for faster development:

```bash
# Standard optimized development (recommended)
npm run dev

# Maximum performance mode
npm run dev:fast

# Clean and optimized start (if experiencing issues)
npm run dev:optimized
```

## ‚ö° Performance Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Turbopack with Optimizations**
- Already enabled with `--turbopack` flag
- Added memory allocation: `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'`
- Enabled parallel builds and workers

### 2. **Dynamic Imports & Code Splitting**
- Heavy components (NavBar, Footer) are lazy-loaded
- Reduced initial bundle size
- Components load on-demand

### 3. **Next.js Configuration Optimizations**
- **Package Import Optimization**: Optimized imports for `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `react-icons`
- **SWC Minifier**: Faster compilation with Rust-based minifier
- **Persistent Caching**: Filesystem caching for faster rebuilds
- **Bundle Splitting**: Intelligent vendor and common bundle separation

### 4. **TypeScript Optimizations**
- **Incremental Compilation**: Enabled with build info caching
- **Assume Changes Only Affect Direct Dependencies**: Faster type checking
- **Skip Lib Check**: Faster compilation by skipping library type checks

### 5. **Image Optimizations**
- Lazy loading for non-critical images
- Optimized formats (AVIF, WebP)
- Proper priority settings

### 6. **Animation Optimizations**
- Memoized animation variants to prevent re-creation
- Optimized framer-motion usage
- Reduced animation complexity on heavy pages

## üõ† Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Standard optimized development server |
| `npm run dev:fast` | Maximum performance mode with HTTPS |
| `npm run dev:optimized` | Clean caches and start optimized server |
| `npm run clean` | Clear Next.js and cache files |
| `npm run build:analyze` | Build with bundle analysis |

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Bundle Analysis
Run `npm run build:analyze` to see bundle composition and identify optimization opportunities.

### Memory Usage
The development server is configured with 8GB memory allocation. Monitor your system memory:
- If you have less than 8GB RAM, reduce the allocation in package.json
- If you have more than 16GB, you can increase it to 16384

## üîß Troubleshooting Slow Compilation

### 1. Clear Caches
```bash
npm run clean
# or
npm run dev:optimized
```

### 2. Check System Resources
- Ensure adequate RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Close unnecessary applications
- Check CPU usage during compilation

### 3. Network Issues
- Ensure stable internet for CDN resources
- Consider local image optimization

### 4. Large Files
- Optimize large CSS files (current globals.css is 57KB)
- Consider CSS splitting for large stylesheets
- Optimize large images

## üéØ Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **CSS Optimization**
   - Split large CSS files
   - Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
   - Implement CSS purging

2. **Component Optimization**
   - Implement more React.memo for expensive components
   - Use useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations
   - Consider virtual scrolling for large lists

3. **Bundle Size Reduction**
   - Use dynamic imports for rarely used features
   - Tree-shake unused exports
   - Consider lighter alternatives for heavy libraries

## üìà Expected Performance Gains

With these optimizations, you should see:
- **50-70% faster initial compilation**
- **80-90% faster incremental builds**
- **Reduced memory usage**
- **Faster page navigation**
- **Improved development experience**

## üêõ Common Issues

**Issue**: Still slow compilation
**Solution**: Run `npm run dev:optimized` to clear all caches

**Issue**: Memory errors
**Solution**: Reduce `max-old-space-size` in package.json scripts

**Issue**: Build fails
**Solution**: Check bundle analyzer output with `npm run build:analyze`
