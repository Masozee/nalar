# ✅ Admin Page UI Rules (ShadCN Only)

## 1. General Rules

1. **Use Only ShadCN Components**  
   All UI must be built using components from [ShadCN UI](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) or Radix UI only

2. **Stick to Latest Versions**  
   Only use the latest documented ShadCN or RadixUI components. No custom-built or outdated components.

3. **Don't Modify Fixed Components**  
   If a component is already implemented and marked as “✅ Done”, **do not refactor, re-style, or modify it.**

4. **Style Consistency**  
   Follow ShadCN + Tailwind utility-first principles. No custom CSS unless explicitly needed.

5. **No External UI Libraries**  
   Do not import or use any other component libraries like Chakra, MUI, Bootstrap, etc.

6. **Form Handling**  
   Use `react-hook-form` + `zod` combo with ShadCN’s form components.

7. **Icons**  
   Only use `lucide-react` for icons.

8. **Animation**  
   Use `framer-motion` for any animations or transitions.

9. **Sidebar**  
   Don't change sidebar, except i'm directly asking to change it


## 2. ✅ Component Implementation Checklist

1. create new docs to documented new created pages with components location 
2. Mark the components and pages you've already implemented. Do **not modify** components that are marked ✅ Done.



## 3. Notes

- Update the checklist as you go.
- Before adding any custom behavior, check if ShadCN or Radix UI already supports it.
- When in doubt, refer to the official ShadCN docs: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components
